## FAQs {#FAQs}

Why do I need my chimney swept?

: There are many benefits to maintaining your flue, but these are the three main
reasons:

1. **Fuel Efficiency:** In order for your appliance to work the way it was
   designed there needs to there needs to be sufficient air flow into it and
   up the flue to vent gasses. A build-up of soot in a flue liner will
   compromise the material and shorten the life of your flue.
2. **Chimney fire:** A build-up of soot and creosote in your flue can lead to
   a fire which can be spread through the roof and destroy a home.
3. **CO poisoning:** Carbon Monoxide is an invisible, odourless and tasteless
   gas which given improper ventilation can quickly build up in a property and
   kill.

How do I know when my chimney needs cleaning?

: Depends on the fuel you are using:

- Coal - twice per year
- Wood - Every quarter when in use
- Smokeless – once per year
- Gas – once per year
- Oil – once per year

This is a general guide, depending on your use of the appliance and the
quality of your fuel you may need to do it more or less often but you should
always have it swept at least once per year. If you have any soot falling down
the chimney, can see any visible tar on the chimney walls or there is any
smoke coming back into the room then it is always best to ask our expert
advice.

What needs to be done for when the chimney sweep is coming?

: When you ring up for an appointment you will be advised of how to prepare for
your specific appliance. Having said that, it needs to be cold, free of embers
and ash (as this will slow the process down as it has to be cleared before the
sweep can begin). The chimney sweep will need space to work free of hearth
furniture and any precious things on or around the mantle.
